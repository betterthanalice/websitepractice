    	<h4 class="home-hello">Hello!<h4>
    	<p>My name is Patricia, welcome to my first ever website! 
I've been taking HTML and CSS tutorials off and on for about three years. 
I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, but I'm having fun!
<br> <br>I'm currently working as an office manager at a local free clinic 
where I've worked with Adobe Illustrator extensively to produce flyers, 
organizational mailings and other materials. I love the work but I'd definitely 
like to expand my skillset by learning how to build websites and the basics of programming.
<br><br><span class="invitation">Come with me on my journey of self-actualization!</span></p>
